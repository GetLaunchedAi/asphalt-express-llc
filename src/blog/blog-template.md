# The Benefits of Professional Sealcoating

Professional sealcoating is one of the most important maintenance services you can provide for your asphalt surfaces. Here's why sealcoating should be part of your regular maintenance routine:

## Protection Against the Elements

Sealcoating provides a protective barrier against:
- UV rays that can cause oxidation and fading
- Water penetration that leads to cracking
- Oil and chemical spills
- Freeze-thaw cycles

## Cost-Effective Maintenance

Regular sealcoating is much more cost-effective than major repairs or replacement. It can extend the life of your asphalt surface by several years.

## Improved Appearance

Fresh sealcoating gives your asphalt surfaces a like-new appearance, enhancing your property's curb appeal and professional image.

## When to Sealcoat

We recommend sealcoating every 2-3 years for most surfaces. High-traffic areas may require more frequent application.

## Professional Application

Professional sealcoating ensures proper preparation, application, and curing for optimal results. Contact Asphalt Express LLC for your sealcoating needs throughout Michigan.
