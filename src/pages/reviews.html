          since. Why bother, when Sam is THE BEST! On time, always professional, excellent job, friendly, reasonably
          priced, carpet always looks fantastic. I've recommended him, and those have recommended him to others."</p>

          kids destroyed the carpet through out the house. Miracle carpet care was on time, and very professional. They
          made the kitchen grout and floors look new again, and the carpet looks beautiful now. I have recommended them
          to all my friends and colleagues! Thank you Miracle Carpet Care!"</p>

        <p class="review-text">"The best of the best. My wife and I have used Miracle Carpet Care twice and have found
          that they do a better job than anyone else we have used previously during the six years we have lived in Ann
          Arbor. Since this is a family-owned company (father and sons), it's not surprising that they take great pride
          and care in the work they do. Not only is their work first-class and priced right, but they are friendly and
          dependable. I give them the highest possible rating and recommendation. I wouldn't think of using any other
          company!"</p>

        <p class="review-text">"Excellent Service...Beautiful Results. Sam was prompt and got to work quickly. The
          carpet is a light color and easily stained by the cat. It looked like new and no remaining stains after the
          cleaning. Highly recommend this business. Will definitely be seeing them again in the future!"</p>

        <p class="review-text">"Great Service and Pricing - Always Beautiful Results. Wouldn't consider using any carpet
          cleaning service other than Miracle Carpet Care and Sam. They are top notch in service, pricing and
          professionalism. Sam gets back to you promptly when you contact him, and goes the extra mile to make sure you
          are happy with results. We have a fairly large dog and an inside cat, and also light carpeting so the carpets
          can understandably show some wear. We have used Sam's services twice in the past and have not been anything
          but thrilled with how well the carpets and furniture look after he is finished; couldn't possibly give a
          higher recommendation. Miracle Carpet Care will definitely remain our Go To company whenever we need work
          done. No point in searching farther when you've already found the best!!! Miracle Carpet Care deserves an A++
          rating at the very least - would gladly give higher if it were available. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM - THEY
          WON'T DISAPPOINT!"</p>

        <p class="review-text">"Absolutely the best! Sam is a rare find who is absolutely passionate about what he does
          and providing customers with superior customer service. He is responsive and constantly provides updates
          throughout the process. We are new to the Michigan area and the carpet in the condo was heavily stained. We
          also had bathroom grout cleaned. Due to the condition of the carpet we did not have any hopes of the carpet
          looking relatively new, we just wanted it cleaned. The carpets are cleaned and we are no longer wanting to
          rush out and purchase new carpets. All I can say is that Sam exceeded our expectations! Thank you Sam. It was
          the best welcome to Sterling Heights we could have received. This review is long over due but not forgotten as
          Sam performed this job in March 2017."</p>
